<h1> brief about the project: </h1>
<p>
	The (Xen) Project was mainly aimed to break the tedious cycle of searching a whole website for specific information, a specific picture, or even a bunch of emails .. you end up wasting hours on something that could have been automated with a simple project, or at least that what it is now, we never know how it will evolve in the future, the most important part about the project is that we build the core of the project, which is the web scraping tool. In the end, it will be a great project to offer to the real world .. and I am not talking just about a web scraping tool, I am talking about a whole new system that can search the internet for thousands of results and sort them for you.<br />
	but for now, we will start simple. along with this project, the CEO will develop other projects such as (Project-Storm)  and (sfesten) .. which might be able to be integrated into the (Xen) project later in an advanced stage. it's wonderfull what we can build with these new technologies.
